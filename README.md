# Street Party

## Concept
#### Original Concept
Inspired by the Queens jubilee, a member of our group had an idea for an app which would help to organise street parties. This was following a bad experience attempting to host a party on his own street with some minor success. It could have definitely been improved with better organisation!

#### Developing the Concept
Darren Firth was the originator of the app concept. In order to help explain the concept he created some basic designs including constructs and routings.

#### Final Design Concept
Tom Nunn is a front end developer with a background in design. Following discussions about the concept he mocked up some designs as to how he believed the final product could look. We have all aimed to reproduce these designs in the final product.

On this page we put down everyone's ideas which could possibly be implemented.

Once we had everyone's initial ideas it was then necessary to whittle down the ideas into groups of MVP, Nice-to-Have and Moonshoots.

After having the product broken down into each category it was then necessary to flesh out the MVP ideas.

#### Waffle

After breaking the project down into smaller pieces it was now possible to make them into user stories. Once they were individual user stories we were able to utilize the Kanban style of project management along with Scrum mentalities.
